# Class Assignment 2 (CA2) 

# Introduction
Welcome to Class Assignment 2 (CA2) Part 1 and Part 2! In this assignment, we will be working with a basic Gradle application to introduce new functionalities and deepen our understanding of Gradle's capabilities.

# Objective
The objective of CA2 Part 2 is to gain familiarity with Gradle build tools by converting an existing Maven project to Gradle. We will explore the differences between Maven, ant/ivy and Gradle, understand Gradle's build configuration, and learn how to manage dependencies, tasks, and plugins in a Gradle project.

# Overview

## Part 1: 

In Part 1 of CA2, we will focus on incorporating new tasks into the build.gradle file, such as running the server, creating unit tests, and implementing backup and archiving functionalities.

## Part 2: 

In Part 2 of CA2, we will be converting the basic version of the Tutorial application from Maven to Gradle build tools. This conversion will involve:

1. Setting up a Gradle project structure.
2. Configuring Gradle build files (build.gradle).
3. Managing dependencies using Gradle.
4. Defining tasks and plugins in Gradle.


By completing this assignment, you will gain practical experience with Gradle and build tools, which are essential skills for modern software development practices.


We hope you enjoy working on this assignment and find it insightful in your journey to mastering Gradle and software development practices. Let's dive in and start exploring CA2!
